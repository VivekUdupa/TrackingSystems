Excented Kalman filter demonstration using TrackSim program

-------------------- The basics --- use 's' to run, so can pause

SysNoise->Gaussian
Display scale:  128:1 (default)
MeasNoise scale:  1.0 (default)
SysNoise scale:  vary from 0.0625 to 1.0 (shows different amounts of
            distortion, resembling spool unwinding in textile machine)

Show measurements only -- can you see the state?  Very difficult!

-------------------- Show KF on this type of system
	note:  MeasNoise/SysNoise = actual MEAS_NOISE/DYN_NOISE = filter

Display->Filtered state
tune DYN_NOISE down to 0.03125 (can start to see sinusoid)
            sinusoid of filter lags actual state, why?
tune DYN_NOISE down to 0.003906 (smoother but lags even more, why?)


-------------------- Show EKF on this system
Filter->EKF
system->reset
tracks very closely

turn SysNoise up steadily, see filter maintain

turn off Display->Actual so can only see measurements again

switch between filter->KF and filter->EKF, comparing performance
